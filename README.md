# hello-world

Hello !

I absolutely love watching Anime and reading Mangas (NOT a weeb though lol). Cooking is another thing I'm really passionate about and I spend a lot of time elevating old recipes or trying out new ones. No matter if I spend my whole day cooking or watching Anime/reading Mangas I always take a couple hours out of my day to go to the gym and improve not only my physical but also my mental strenght.
